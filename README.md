<h3>WPF Demos</h3>

(This project was built and tested in .NET Framework 4.6.1)

This is a bundle of 3 WPF demos: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Button Slider:</b> A text box and two sliders binded to a button (An example of basic binding).</li>
  <li><b>Arithmetic Game:</b> A math quiz with basic addition exercises, and with limited time to choose the correct answer. </li>
  <li><b>Web Loader:</b> A window that loads a web page using a given URL and displays its number of characters. </li>
</ul>

This Project is built on WPF (C#). It's a very good example of basic MVVM concepts like ViewModel and PropertyChanged and Command.
The project also includes Tasks and async-await to implement asynchronous behavior.

This is a nice introduction to WPF and I Hope you will find this repository valuable for you.
